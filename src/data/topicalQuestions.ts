    question:
      "**Define** photosynthesis and explain its importance in ecosystems.",
    answer:
      "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert *light energy* into **chemical energy** (glucose) using carbon dioxide and water. It is crucial for ecosystems as it provides the primary source of energy for most food chains, produces oxygen for respiration, and removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.",

    question:
      "Describe the structure and function of **chloroplasts**. Include a labeled diagram.",
    answer:
      "Chloroplasts are double-membrane organelles containing thylakoids arranged in stacks called *grana*. They contain **chlorophyll** which captures light energy. The stroma contains enzymes for the Calvin cycle. Function includes light-dependent and light-independent reactions of photosynthesis.",

    question:
      "Explain the process of **mitosis** and its significance in multicellular organisms.",
    answer:
      "Mitosis is nuclear division producing two genetically identical diploid cells. Stages include *prophase*, *metaphase*, *anaphase*, and *telophase*. Significance includes growth, repair, asexual reproduction, and maintaining chromosome number.",

    question: "What is the function of **ATP** in cellular processes?",
    answer:
      "ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) is the universal energy currency of cells. It provides energy for metabolic reactions, active transport, muscle contraction, and biosynthesis through hydrolysis of phosphate bonds.",

    questionNumber: "3b",
    question: "Compare and contrast **aerobic** and **anaerobic** respiration.",
    answer:
      "Both break down glucose to release energy. **Aerobic** respiration requires oxygen, produces 38 ATP, and forms COâ‚‚ and water. **Anaerobic** respiration occurs without oxygen, produces 2 ATP, and forms lactate (animals) or ethanol (plants/yeast). Aerobic is more efficient.",
